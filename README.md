## Run Application
You have 2 options to run application:
1. **Using Docker**:
    - Pull the application Docker Image from the `juliparodi/apps` public repository with this command:
      ```bash
      docker pull juliparodi/superhero-app:latest
      ```
    - Then run it in detached mode on port 8443:
      ```bash
      docker run -d -p 8443:8443 juliparodi/superhero-app:latest
      ```
2. **Cloning the Repository**:
   - You can clone [superhero-repository](https://github.com/Juliparodi/super-hero-api) and:
     - Run it locally using your preferred IDE.
         - Create a JAR by executing:
           ```bash
           mvn package
           ```
         - This will create a JAR named "superhero.jar" in the `/target` folder. You can run it locally or on another server or computer by executing:
           ```bash
           java -jar superhero.jar
           ```

## How to Use

To get started with the Superhero API, follow these simple steps:

2. **Making Requests**: Once application is running you can make requests to the API using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) from [Swagger](https://localhost:8443/swagger-ui/index.html).

3. **API Documentation**: SuperHero API is thoroughly documented using Swagger, a user-friendly interactive documentation tool. You can explore all available endpoints, request/response formats, and example requests by visiting our [Swagger Documentation](http://localhost:8443/swagger-ui/index.html). This is the best place to get detailed information on how to use our API effectively.

4. **Test**: The SuperHero API is thoroughly tested using a comprehensive suite of tests, including unit, functional, and integration tests. These tests are designed to ensure the reliability, functionality, and security of the API.
    - To run tests just execute in the root diretory
      - `mvn test`

## Security

Security is a top priority for the Superhero API. We use industry-standard security practices to protect your data and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your requests. All communication between clients and the backend is secured with HTTPS, so every request is encrypted in transit.

Authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Only users with a valid token can access the API, and each token encodes the userâ€™s role, which is used for authorization.

- GET resources: To retrieve superheroes or search results, you must authenticate and have the role of USER.

- POST, PUT, DELETE resources: To create, update, or delete superheroes, you must authenticate and have the role of ADMIN.

## Credentials

**Please take note that this is a TEST application, if this was supposed to be a production app you surely have to ask for this credentials to security team**

- User (to access only GET resources):
  - username: user
  - password: user123

- Admin (to access all resources):
  - username: admin
  - password: admin123

## Monitoring

Super Hero exposes metrics via Actuator at /actuator/prometheus. A Prometheus sidecar scrapes these metrics and exposes a route that can be used by Grafana dashboards. The dashboards visualize request rates, latency, errors, JVM health, and custom business metrics. Spring Security ensures only authorized access to sensitive endpoints while allowing monitoring. This setup provides secure, real-time insights into application performance and health.
